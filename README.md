# ðŸ”¬ phys-vae: Physicsâ€‘based Variational Autoencoder

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and bash scripts for training and evaluating **physics-informed variational autoencoders** across multiple datasets and experimental setups.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Description

- The project focuses on learning representations from datasets with underlying physics constraints.
- It includes experiments across domains like **advection-diffusion**, **galaxy modeling**, **locomotion**, and **pendulum dynamics**.
- Notebooks ending with `_new.ipynb` are the **latest and recommended versions** that generate results directly.

## ðŸš€ Running All Experiments

To run each full experiment suite with one command, use the provided scripts:

```bash
./run_all_advdif.sh       # Advection-Diffusion
./run_all_galaxy.sh       # Galaxy generation
./run_all_locomotion.sh   # Locomotion dataset
./run_all_pendulum.sh     # Pendulum experiments
# Physics-integrated variational autoencoders for robust and interpretable generative modeling
```
Implementation of the method presented in the following paper:

NOTE: Some notations are not consistent between the paper and the codes here. If you find something too unclear, feel free to ask me! You can find contact information from my website.

## Prerequisite

- Python 3.8.3
- NumPy 1.19.2
- SciPy 1.5.2
- PyTorch 1.7.0
- pytorchvision 0.8.1 (for galaxy experiment)
- torchdiffeq (for pendulum/advdif/locomotion experiments)

## Usage

First, create data with `makedata.sh` or `makedata.m` in each data directory. You have to first download original data for the galaxy and locomotion datasets; see corresponding readme.txt.

You can train NN+phys(+reg) model using scripts [EXPTNAME]\_train.sh, for example by `. advdif_train.sh physnn`.
Then the .ipynb files perform some experiments shown in the paper.
